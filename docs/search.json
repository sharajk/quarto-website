Through my self-portraits, I aim to capture the essence of my own being and reflect on my own journey through time. Each photograph is a reflection of my own experiences and emotions. Through my photography, I hope to offer a glimpse into my life as a scholar and adventurer, and inspire others to reflect on their own journeys through the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"

    "text": "Article | Code\nCollaborators: Ariana Strandburg-Peshkin , Helge Giese , Pranav Minasandra , Sumantra Sarkar , Mohit Kumar Jolly and Nico Gradwohl\nIn an age characterized by unprecedented access to information through online social networks, understanding how collective opinions are influenced by users choosing their communication partners is essential to disentangle the mechanisms of polarization and deadlocks. Importantly, the direction of user choice is context dependent: for example, on Twitter, users choose who they receive information from while following public accounts but choose who they send information to while setting Twitter circles. Similarly, on YouTube, users choose who they receive content from when they subscribe to a channel, but creators choose who to send content to while targeting video campaigns. Here, we study how the autonomy that users have in manipulating their communication networks interacts with collective opinions. Using numerical simulations, we show that consensus decisions can be biased by users avoiding disagreeing others (e.g. homophily) as a function of whether they send or receive information. Avoiding disagreeing others assorts users into like-minded clusters, and such clusters facilitated consensus outcomes in favour of users who either retained disagreeing links while sending information or broke disagreeing links while receiving information. Besides highlighting the importance of context-specific effects of user link selection, we show boundary conditions under which these effects matter. These findings shed light on the importance of considering how user choice interacts with communication networks when informing interventions against structural polarization in media."

I’m affiliated with the Communication, Media and Marginalization (CoMM)  lab and the Experiential AI Institute (EAI). I work with Dr. Samuel Scarpino and Prof. Brooke Foucault Welles.\nI’m broadly interested in studying how media discourses surrounding queer issues evolve and reflect (if not drive) public attitudes. While I’m still developing my dissertation project, my current work focuses on devising mixed-methods approaches to study media coverage surrounding queer health. On one hand, I conduct qualitative thematic analysis to contextualize the discourse within a broader history of perceptions surrounding sexuality and its intersection with other facets of social identity. On the other, I leverage state of the art language models to scale up my analysis onto large corpuses of text.\nAs an interdisciplinary researcher, I draw on scholarship from political communication, critical media studies, public health, complex systems and computational social sciences. I’ve worked on complex communication processes in systems ranging from kalahari meerkats to online media, using methods ranging from statistical physics-inspired numerical simulations, to qualitative text analysis and surveys. While most of my vocational training has been positivist in its philosophy, I’ve recently come to appreciate interpretivist and critical approaches to doing science, and have been integrating the same in my work. Checkout my projects page for more details on my research.\nOutside of work, I love cooking elaborate meals, playing board games and listening to RnB/jazz. I owe a lot to other queer, trans and immigrant academics who’ve inspired and helped me through my career, and would love to contribute my part to your journey. As this website evolves, I’ll include resources and blogposts to facilitate this process. Meanwhile, I’m always up for a conversation and love nerding out, so feel free to hit me up at any of my above socials!"
