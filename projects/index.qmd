In an age characterized by unprecedented access to information through online social networks, understanding how collective opinions are influenced by users choosing their communication partners is essential to disentangle the mechanisms of polarization and deadlocks. Importantly, the direction of user choice is context dependent: for example, on Twitter, users choose who they receive information from while following public accounts but choose who they send information to while setting Twitter circles. Similarly, on YouTube, users choose who they receive content from when they subscribe to a channel, but creators choose who to send content to while targeting video campaigns. Here, we study how the autonomy that users have in manipulating their communication networks interacts with collective opinions. Using numerical simulations, we show that consensus decisions can be biased by users avoiding disagreeing others (e.g. homophily) as a function of whether they send or receive information. Avoiding disagreeing others assorts users into like-minded clusters, and such clusters facilitated consensus outcomes in favour of users who either retained disagreeing links while sending information or broke disagreeing links while receiving information. Besides highlighting the importance of context-specific effects of user link selection, we show boundary conditions under which these effects matter. These findings shed light on the importance of considering how user choice interacts with communication networks when informing interventions against structural polarization in media.
